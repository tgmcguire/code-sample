# Code Samples

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

In this repository, you'll find a selection of code samples, including:

- An [AngularJS](angular.js) single-page app, with a [partial](angular_partial.html)
- A [Sass](sass.scss) file
- A [controller](Controller.php), [view](View.php), [model](Model.php), and [utility class](Utility.php) built on a custom framework

Please note that certain elements in these samples have been redacted, with this being a public repository. Certainly feel free to inquire about anything you see â€“ or don't see, for that matter!
